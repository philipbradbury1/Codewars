/*
Description:


Remember the triangle of balls in billiards? To build a classic triangle (5 levels) you need 15 balls. With 3 balls you can build a 2-level triangle, etc.

For more examples,

pyramid(1) == 1

pyramid(3) == 2

pyramid(6) == 3

pyramid(10) == 4

pyramid(15) == 5
Write a function that takes number of balls (â‰¥ 1) and calculates how many levels you can build a triangle.

*/

function pyramid(ballss) {

    let levels = 0;
    let balls = ballss;
    let n = 1;

    while (balls > 0 && balls >= n) {
        balls = balls - n;
        levels++;
        n++;
    }

    return levels
}
